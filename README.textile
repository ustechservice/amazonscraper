A scraper for Amazon Wish List items that are cheaper than a specified price. Note that the scraper cannot get a price for some items (possibly because they are out of stock) and so these are listed as "We can't get a price". An example of one of these items is: "Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore":http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0374214913.
